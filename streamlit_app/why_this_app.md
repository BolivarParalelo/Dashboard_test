That's an excellent question and a very important one for any software engineering project!

Building this intermediary API (your FastAPI application) definitely has significant advantages over directly interacting with Binance's (or any other exchange's) P2P API endpoints. Here's why it makes sense, especially if you're aiming for a "P2P Dashboard" and a production-ready product:

**Advantages of Building Your Own API (this app):**

1.  **Abstraction and Unified Interface:**
    *   **Multiple Exchanges:** If you plan to integrate Bybit, KuCoin, or other exchanges in the future, each will have its own unique API structure, authentication, and data formats. Your FastAPI app can provide a **single, consistent API interface** for all of them. Your frontend (or any consumer of your API) only needs to know how to talk to *your* API, not each individual exchange's API.
    *   **Simplified Consumption:** Your API can expose data in a format that's most convenient for your dashboard, even if the underlying exchange APIs are complex or inconsistent.

2.  **Custom Logic and Data Processing:**
    *   **Advanced Filtering & Aggregation:** You can implement custom filtering, sorting, and data aggregation logic on your server. For example, you might want to find arbitrage opportunities across exchanges, calculate average prices, or filter by specific payment methods that aren't directly supported by the exchange's API. This offloads processing from the client and allows for more complex business logic.
    *   **Data Enrichment:** You could enrich the data with additional information (e.g., historical price trends, user reputation scores from multiple sources) that isn't available directly from the exchange.

3.  **Performance and Scalability:**
    *   **Caching:** You can implement caching mechanisms within your API. If multiple users request the same data frequently, your API can serve it from a cache instead of hitting the external exchange API every time, significantly improving response times and reducing load on the external API.
    *   **Rate Limit Management:** Exchange APIs often have strict rate limits. Your API can intelligently manage these limits, queuing requests or introducing delays to ensure you don't get blocked, while still providing a smooth experience to your users.

4.  **Security:**
    *   **API Key Protection:** If external APIs require API keys or other sensitive credentials, your backend can securely store and manage them. Exposing these directly in a client-side application (like a web dashboard) is a major security risk.
    *   **Access Control:** You can implement your own authentication and authorization layers to control who can access your P2P data, which is essential if you plan to make this dashboard available to others.

5.  **Resilience and Maintainability:**
    *   **Insulation from External Changes:** If an exchange changes its API (e.g., modifies an endpoint, changes a response field), you only need to update your scraper logic within your FastAPI app. All client applications consuming your API remain unaffected, as your API maintains its consistent interface.
    *   **Centralized Logging and Monitoring:** You have a central place to log errors, monitor API calls, and debug issues related to data fetching, rather than scattering this logic across multiple client applications.

6.  **Data Storage and Analytics:**
    *   **Historical Data:** As mentioned in the `README.md`, you can easily integrate a database to store historical P2P data. This enables trend analysis, backtesting strategies, and building more sophisticated features that rely on past data.

**When Direct Interaction Might Be Simpler:**

*   **Very Simple, One-Off Use Cases:** If you only need to fetch a single piece of data from one exchange, very infrequently, and don't require any custom processing or security, then a direct call might be quicker to implement.
*   **Learning/Experimentation:** For initial exploration of an exchange's API, direct calls are useful.

**Conclusion:**

For a "P2P Dashboard" that implies ongoing use, potential integration with multiple sources, custom features, and a user-friendly experience, building this intermediary FastAPI application is not only sensible but highly recommended. It provides a robust, scalable, secure, and maintainable foundation for your project.
